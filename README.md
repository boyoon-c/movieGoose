## Description

**movie goose**, a movie-search and movie-review web application, has two main features: 
1) it provides basic information about movies, such as their respective genre, casts, directors, and plot, as well as its unique collection of the reviews created by its users, and
2) users could add their favorite movies to their "likes list" and create/update/delete reviews about a movie so that other users that are also using the application could check them out.
